# Introduction 

### ~={yellow}what is JavaScript=~ ?
javascript is an dynamic ,interpreted, weakly typed programming lang, that **%% compiled at Runtime %%**
, it can be executed as part of webpage in a browser or any machine ( Literarily)
- it was made to make the webpages more dynamic 
- it dosent have any thing to do with Java , it was just naming coz java was popular back then 
ok now we are going to ask another question 
### ~={purple}How Do webpages Work=~ 
![[Pasted image 20250714235418.png]]

here java script help us make it more responsive , maybe check the response that from the Server

i think its not an good idea to write everything ,amma just gonna write the usefull things only

Js is an **interpreted** lang which mean its 'on the fly' compiled
and its hosted enviroment and can run in another enviroments
## How JavaScript is Executed
 the code we wrote goes into JavaScript Engine 
 ![[Pasted image 20250715003521.png]]
 in the engine it parse the code then compils it to machine code the exectue  
 but the JAVA Script only runs on Single Thread

## what is Weakly Typed and Dynamic Dose Mean 

#### ~={orange}Dynamic Interpreted lang mean=~: 
js is not pre-compiled 
Code Evaluated and Executed at Runtime 
Code can Change at runtime
#### ~={pink} Weakly Typed Lang mean=~:
when work with data in js we dont need to tell js that we typing an text or an number


## so how it works on Host Environments 
it works with Node.js and Google JavaScript Engine V8

some info about js 
EcmaScript : an standard orginazation that evolves ...blah blah blah

Enviroment 
use Chrome for development coz its better
