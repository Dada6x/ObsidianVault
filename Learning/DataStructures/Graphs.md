what are Graphs ?

graphs are non-linear Data Structures [[Data Structures]]
what makes them diffrent than the trees that there is no Parent-Child Relationship 
there are nodes and edges 

- graph can have zero or more links between nodes 
- some times they have **weights** so we call em [[#Weighted Graphs]]
- sometimes they have Arrows so we called them [[#Directed-Graphs]]

### simple Graphs

simple graphs have no loops and no node can link to itself
