##  What is Modus Ponens?

**Modus Ponens** is a rule of reasoning that says:

> If a statement of the form "If P, then Q" is true, and P is true,  
> then Q **must also be true**.

### 🔹 Structure (Logic Form)
- Premise 1: If **P**, then **Q**   (P → Q)
- Premise 2: **P** is true
-  Conclusion: **Q** is true

## ✅ Real-World Example

> If I study, then I will pass the exam.  
> I studied.  
> ➡️ Therefore, I will pass the exam.

##  Truth Table for P → Q

|P|Q|P → Q|Why?|
|---|---|---|---|
|F|T|✅|P is false → rule not triggered|
|F|F|✅|P is false → rule not triggered|
|T|T|✅|Rule triggered, and Q happened|
|T|F|❌|Rule triggered, but Q failed ❌|
> 🧠 **Important Rule**: If **P is false**, then **P → Q is always considered true** in logic.

## 🔁 Summary of Modus Ponens

- Only works when:
  - **"If P then Q" is true**
  - **P is also true**
- Then we can **safely conclude Q is true**
- 💡 It’s a valid and reliable way to make logical conclusions.

Some Rules of Inference

## 🧩 1. **Detachment** (Modus Ponens)

> If P → Q, and P is true, then Q is true.

- **Form:**  
      P → Q  
      P 
      --------------
      ∴ Q
    
- **Example:**  
      If it rains, the ground gets wet.  
      It’s raining.  
      → The ground is wet.
    

---

## 🔄 2. **Contrapositive (Modus Tollens)**

> If P → Q, and Q is false, then P is false.

- **Form:**  
      P → Q  
      ¬Q  
      ------------------
      ∴ ¬P
    
- **Example:**  
      If I study, I will pass.  
      I didn’t pass.  
      → I didn’t study.
    

---

## 🔗 3. **Chain Rule (Hypothetical Syllogism)**

> If P → Q and Q → R, then P → R.

- **Form:**  
      P → Q  
      Q → R  
      -----------------------
      ∴ P → R
---

## 🔀 4. **Disjunctive Inference (Disjunctive Syllogism)**

> If P ∨ Q is true, and one is false, the other must be true.

- **Form:**  
      P ∨ Q               P ∨ Q
      ¬P                    ¬ Q
      ---------------- or  ------------------
      ∴ Q                  ∴ P
    
- **Example:**  
      Either I’ll eat pizza or pasta.  
      I’m not eating pizza.  
      → I’m eating pasta.
    

---

## 🚫 5. **Double Negation**

> ¬¬P is the same as P.

- **Form:**  
      ¬(¬P) ≡ P
---

## 🔁 6. **De Morgan’s Laws**

> These show how to negate AND/OR statements.

- **Forms:**  
      ¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ ¬P ∨ ¬Q  
      ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ ¬P ∧ ¬Q

## ✂️ 7. **Simplification**

> From P ∧ Q, you can infer either P or Q.

- **Form:**  
      P ∧ Q  
      ----------------------
      ∴ P (or Q)
    
- **Example:**  
      I am tired and hungry.  
      → I am tired.
    

---

## 🔗 8. **Conjunction**

> If P is true and Q is true, then P ∧ Q is true.

- **Form:**  
      P  
      Q 
      --------------------- 
      ∴ P ∧ Q
    
- **Example:**  
      I am smart.  
      I am funny.  
      → I am smart and funny.
---

## ➕ 9. **Disjunctive Addition**

> From P, you can conclude P ∨ Q (even if Q is unrelated).

- **Form:**  
      P
      --------------------  
      ∴ P ∨ Q
    
- **Example:**  
      I am sleepy.  
      → I am sleepy or a dragon.
    

(Yes, Q can be anything — it’s a valid disjunction!)

---

## 🔗 10. **Conjunctive Argument**

> From P ∧ Q and P → R and Q → S, conclude R ∧ S.

- **Form:**  
      P ∧ Q  
      P → R  
      Q → S  
      ------------------------
      ∴ R ∧ S
    
- **Example:**  
      I study and sleep early.  
      If I study, I’ll pass.  
      If I sleep early, I’ll focus.  
      → I’ll pass and focus
